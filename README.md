Hello!

I'm Peetak Mitra. In my professional life I wear a lot of different hats:

<br> 🌍 I'm a atmospheric scientist with specialization in aerosol-cloud-climate processes.
<br> ⛈ I'm a meteorologist who works on applying AI to weather forecasting and analysis problems.
<br> 🏛 I work adjacent to science-for-policy and policy-for-science applications.
<br> 👨🏻‍💻 I write a lot of code and develop software for many different problem domains.
🚗 I help bring autonomous vehicle systems into the real-world.
